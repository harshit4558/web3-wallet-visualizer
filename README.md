# Web3 HD Wallet

This project is a personal learning tool for exploring Web3 concepts, specifically focusing on building an HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) Wallet. The goal of this project is to practice and deepen my understanding of Web3, Ethereum, Solana, and cryptographic principles, particularly around wallet generation and key management.

## What I've Learned

- **HD Wallet Generation**: I’ve learned how to generate Ethereum and Solana wallets from a mnemonic (seed phrase) using a standard derivation path.
- **Public and Private Keys**: I’ve explored how public and private keys are derived from the mnemonic and how these are used to interact with both the Ethereum and Solana networks.
- **Address Derivation**: I’ve also learned how to convert public keys into Ethereum and Solana addresses.
- **Wallet Management**: The wallet can manage multiple accounts by adjusting the derivation path index.

## Purpose

This project is not meant for production use but as a practice tool to improve my understanding of the Web3 ecosystem. I'm focusing on the basics of how wallets work, how to generate them, and how keys are used within Ethereum and Solana applications.

## Future Work

As I continue to learn more about Web3, I plan to add more features to this project, including:
- Integrating with Ethereum and Solana smart contracts.
- Building more complex wallet management systems.
- Learning about decentralized applications (dApps) and their interaction with Web3 wallets.

Feel free to explore and follow my progress as I learn and build!

## Technologies Used

- **Web3**: To learn and understand blockchain interaction.
- **Ethers.js**: JavaScript library used to handle Ethereum interactions.
- **Solana/web3.js**: JavaScript library for interacting with the Solana blockchain.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building the frontend application.

## Contributing

This is a personal learning project, but contributions are welcome. Feel free to fork and submit pull requests if you have suggestions or improvements.
